Cybercrime has become more sophisticated, widespread, and relentless. Criminals have targeted critical infrastructure—healthcare, information technology, financial services, energy sectors—with headline-grabbing attacks that crippled businesses and harmed consumers. 

In 2020, phishing attack reports more than doubled, with credential phishing being utilized in many of the most destructive attacks. The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) studied online organized criminal networks involved in business email compromise (BEC) and discovered a wide range of methods for obtaining, verifying, and using stolen credentials. To boost the value of their illicit activities, threat actors are expanding their investment in automation and purchasing technologies.

Phishing is the most common sort of malicious email we've seen in our threat signals overall. Phishing emails are sent to all industries, however some verticals are more heavily targeted than others, depending on the attacker's goals, the availability of leaked email addresses, or current events in specific sectors and industries. The number of phishing emails we found in Microsoft Exchange worldwide email flow increased from June 2020 to June 2021, with a noticeable spike in November, possibly due to holiday traffic.
