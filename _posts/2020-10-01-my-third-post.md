<h1> Why use a SharePoint site? </h1>

Organizations use SharePoint to create websites. In Microsoft 365, you can create a site from the SharePoint start page. You also get a SharePoint team site whenever you create a Microsoft 365 group in Outlook Online or Microsoft 365. If you're in SharePoint Server, you can create a team or a number of other types of sites. You can use the sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information from any device. All you need is a web browser, such as Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. There's a SharePoint mobile app as well so you can stay connected anywhere. For example, our job has multiple SharePoint sites to access data revolving our current projects, since we are a Genral Contractor, our job is to have multiple sub-sites for each project so data can be stored and shared amongst team members.
