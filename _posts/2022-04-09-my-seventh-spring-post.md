The most popular programming language of today's developers is Python. The high-level object oriented programming language was founded by Guido van Rossum. Large companies such as Google and Youtube are built on top of Python as it is relatively easy to maintain but has its own fair share of issues. The release of Python3 contains solutions for the commonly found issues with Python.
