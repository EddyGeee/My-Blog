<h1> Groups </h1>

The following groups are used to organize users in both Azure and SharePoint...

- Distribution Group: A group that is used only for e-mail distribution. You cannot add distribution groups to SharePoint groups, but you can expand a distribution group and add the individual members to a SharePoint group.


- Security Group: A security group that can be used to control permissions. You can use security groups to control permissions for your site by adding security groups to SharePoint groups and granting permissions to the SharePoint groups.
