<h1> Multi-Factor Authentication  </h1>

Multi-factor authentication, simply known as MFA, is a process when a user is prompted during sign in for an extra form of identification, such as entering a code from their cellphone or providing a digital finger scan. There are many ways of providing that additional layer of security. 

<h3> Why use it? </h3>

If a user only uses a password to authenticate their login, it leaves it unsecure and open for an easy attack. Especially, if the password is weak or has been exposed anywhere on the web, that account will be vulnerable and you wouldn't know who signed in. When it requires a second form of authentication, security is increased as the additional layers isn't something easy for an attacker to obtain.

MFA works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods:

- typically a password.
- a trusted device that is not easily duplicated, like a phone or hardware key.
- a fingerprint or face scan.

<h4> Available Methods </h4>

When a user signs in to an application or service and receives an MFA prompt, they can choose from one of their registered forms of additional verification.

The following additional forms of verification can be used:

- Microsoft Authenticator app (Ex: AZURE AD)
- Google Authenticator App (Ex: GMAIL)
- Duo Mobile (Ex: CSUN Login)
- SMS (Ex: Anything)
- Voice call (Ex: Anyhting)
